        <h3> The Imposters of Scapin </h3>
        <h4> Act 1: Octave is married to Hyacintha, but
            his father has returned and wants to marry 
            him to someone else. Octave is scared and
            doesn't want to marry this other person. 
        </h4>
        <pre> SCENE II.--OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE.

            SCA. How now, Mr. Octave? What is the matter with you? What is it?
            What trouble are you in? You are all upset, I see.
            
            OCT. Ah! my dear Scapin, I am in despair; I am lost; I am the most
            unfortunate of mortals.
            
            SCA. How is that?
            
            OCT. Don't you know anything of what has happened to me?
            
            SCA. No.
            
            OCT. My father is just returning with Mr. GÃ©ronte, and they want to
            marry me.
            
            SCA. Well, what is there so dreadful about that?
            
            OCT. Alas! you don't know what cause I have to be anxious.
