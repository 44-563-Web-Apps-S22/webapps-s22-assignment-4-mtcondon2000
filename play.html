        <h3> The Imposters of Scapin </h3>
        <h4> Act 1: Octave is married to Hyacintha, but
            his father has returned and wants to marry 
            him to someone else. Octave is scared and
            doesn't want to marry this other person. 
        </h4>
        <pre> <p>SCENE II.--OCTAVE, SCAPIN, SILVESTRE.</p>

            <h4>SCA.</h4> <p>How now, Mr. Octave? What is the matter with you? What is it?
            What trouble are you in? You are all upset, I see.</p>
            
            <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>Ah! my dear Scapin, I am in despair; I am lost; I am the most
            unfortunate of mortals. </p>
            
            <h4>SCA.</h4> <p>How is that?</p>
            
            <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>Don't you know anything of what has happened to me?</p>
            
            <h4>SCA.</h4> <p>No.</p>
            
            <h4>OCT. </h4> <p>My father is just returning with Mr. GÃ©ronte, and they want to marry me.</p>
            
            <h4>SCA.</h4> <p>Well, what is there so dreadful about that?</p>
            
            <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>Alas! you don't know what cause I have to be anxious.</p>
