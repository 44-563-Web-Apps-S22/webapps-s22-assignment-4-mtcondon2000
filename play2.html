    <h3> Continued: </h3>

        <h4 class="name">SCA.</h4> <p class="speech, scapin">No; but it only depends on you that I should soon know; and I am
        a man of consolation, a man who can interest himself in the troubles
        of young people. </p>

        <h4 class="name">OCT.</h4> <p class="speech, octave">Ah! Scapin, if you could find some scheme, invent some plot, to
        get me out of the trouble I am in, I should think myself indebted to
        you for more than life. </p>

        <h4 class="name">SCA.</h4> <p class="speech, scapin">To tell you the truth, there are few things impossible to me
        when I once set about them. Heaven has bestowed on me a fair enough
        share of genius for the making up of all those neat strokes of mother
        wit, for all those ingenious gallantries to which the ignorant and
        vulgar give the name of impostures; and I can boast, without vanity,
        that there have been very few men more skilful than I in expedients
        and intrigues, and who have acquired a greater reputation in the
        noble profession. But, to tell the truth, merit is too ill rewarded
        nowadays, and I have given up everything of the kind since the
        trouble I had through a certain affair which happened to me.</p>

        <h4 class="name">OCT.</h4> <p class="speech, octave">How? What affair, Scapin?</p>
